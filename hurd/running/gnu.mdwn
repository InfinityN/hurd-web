# <a name="The_GNU_Operating_System"> </a> The GNU Operating System

The GNU Operating System, Commonly referred to as simply "The GNU System", is a
complete [[Unix]]-like operating system composed entirely of [free
software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).  The creation of the GNU
System is one of the goals of the [GNU Project](http://www.gnu.org/), which was
[launched in 1983](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html) by
[Richard Stallman](http://www.stallman.org/).  It has many ambitious goals that
the GNU/Hurd intends to address.

These goals include increased security through the [[principle of least
privilege|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle%5Fof%5Fleast%5Fprivilege]], an
[[extensible system|extensibility]], conformation to open operating standards
including [[POSIX|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX]], modularity, and
respecting user freedom.  Many of these goals are things that the GNU/Hurd can
resolve, however the GNU/Hurd is not the most stable operating system yet.

If you are looking for a production ready GNU system, then [[hurd/running/Debian]] GNU/Hurd may
not be the best choice for you.  Debian GNU/Hurd currently lacks 64-bit support,
many device drivers, sound support, SMP, and a few other essential bits that
provide a flexible operating system.

However, [[gnu.org|https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html]] maintains a
list of freedom respecting and production ready GNU/Linux systems.  One of the
most promising of these is [[GuixSD|https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/]], which
is the GNU Guix System Distribution, which eventually plans to support the GNU
Hurd as the kernel!

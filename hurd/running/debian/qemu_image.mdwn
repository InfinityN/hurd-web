There is a QEMU image with [[Debian GNU/Hurd|debian]] pre-installed available
as <https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.tar.gz>.

Usage:

* Install qemu-kvm via your distribution's package manager (it might just be named qemu)

* Download the debian image:

<!-- Codeblocks nested in lists are garbage in Markdown. The only clean way to do this is by adding a comment after every list entry. Sorry about this!-->

	$ wget https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.tar.gz

* Unpack it:

<!-- Yes, another comment. I can leave these empty but then again I can fill them. -->

	$ tar -xz < debian-hurd.img.tar.gz

* Run it:

<!-- A world in which nobody washes their dishes is a dishtopia -->

	$ kvm -m 1G -drive cache=writeback,file=$(echo debian-hurd-*.img) -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22

* Login as root (the root password is empty)

* Set up a root password with passwd

Optionally you may use `--curses` to keep your keyboard layout. If need be modprobe kvm_amd, kvm intel and kvm to get kvm support (which is much, much faster).

Note that if you do not have a command named `kvm`, you can try something across the lines of:

	$ qemu-system-i386 --enable-kvm -drive cche=writeback,file=$(echo debian-hurd-*.img) -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22

Or, if your machine does not allow for KVM acceleration, omit `--enable-kvm` from the command.



Please also read the README file: <https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/README>

If you have troubles extracting the image, you can use
the gz version <https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.gz>,
the zip version <https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.zip>,
or even the plain version <https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img> (5GiB!)
